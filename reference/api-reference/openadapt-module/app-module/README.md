  (nicegui native application)

# ðŸ“¦ app (module)

## Background

### Motivation

* A user-interface is necessary for users to feel comfortable using OpenAdapt. The CLI is too intimidating.
* The tray provides notifications, to let the user know the state of the application

### Literature review

* [https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/PySide6/QtWidgets/index.html](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/PySide6/QtWidgets/index.html) (tray)
* [https://nicegui.io/documentation](https://nicegui.io/documentation) (app)

## Goals

* The tray should make interacting with OpenAdapt easier
* The application should never fail on its own
* The tray should always reflect the state of the DB (always up-to-date)
* The app and tray should be responsive and quick.

## Analysis

The app window could look better and may be hard to see.

If an error occurs, the tray might get blocked, so the process may have to be killed.
